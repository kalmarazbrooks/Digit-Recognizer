# Digit-Recognizer

Data Science
Project 5 - Digit Recognizer
Project Goal
Compete in Kaggle's Digit Recognizer Competition to see how well you can predict written digits using the classic MNIST dataset!

Requirements
You will work in a local Jupyter notebook(s) and upload submissions to Kaggle for auto-scoring.
You may make as many submissions to Kaggle as the competition allows (5 per day).
You should keep all your submission files. (One nice thing to do is to append a timestamp into the filename.)
Feel free to create multiple notebooks for different approaches if it keeps things clear.
You should show visualizations of the training processes and draw conclusions from them, which you communicate via markdown cells.
You should use all the techniques shown in https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning to build the best model possible.
Hints
Beware that if you run model.fit() multiple times, you are fitting on an already fit model. You need to start the fit process over by redefining the model. The best way to do this is to keep model definition and fitting within the same cell.
Loss function: you can look into proper loss functions for categorical work. You might try different cross-entropy versions.
Datasets
The data are available at the Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data 
Submit
It is helpful to add submission scores at the end of your notebook to keep track of which approach worked best.
